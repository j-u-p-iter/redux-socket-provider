# REDUX SOCKET PROVIDER

## Table of Contents

## The problem

There're a lot of different ways to organise your codebase to provide socket communication between server and client.
Such wide range of variants leads to confusion. As developers we prefer to set up structured, conventional rules for the
purpose of consistency. It's easier and more joyable to play the game, when you know the rules.

## The solution

This package sets up for you some set of rules to make socket communication between client and 
server more predictable and structured in react applications, that use redux pattern.
